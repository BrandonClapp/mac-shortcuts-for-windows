Frequently swapping between OSX and Windows devices can be frustrating due to keyboard shortcut muscle memory. This is a hacked together solution for mapping familiar Mac OSX shortcuts to their Windows equivilent counterpart, at least for basic functionality and text editing.

## 1. Install SharpKeys

SharpKeys is a tool that can be used to remap keys to other keys. This is my configuration, which maps Left Ctrl to Left Alt and vice-versa.
